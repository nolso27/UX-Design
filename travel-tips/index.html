                <p class="content-text">
                    <strong>By Air:</strong> Almost all visitors arrive to Taniti by air. Our island is served by a small airport that can accommodate small jets and propeller planes. We are currently expanding the airport so larger jets will be able to land on the island within the next few years.
                </p>
                <p class="content-text">
                    <strong>By Sea:</strong> Some visitors arrive on a small cruise ship that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per week. If you're arriving via cruise, you'll have a day to explore our beautiful island before continuing your journey.
                </p>

                <p class="content-text">
                    <strong>Public Transportation:</strong> Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day. Private buses serve the rest of the island. These provide an economical way to explore the island.
                </p>
                <p class="content-text">
                    <strong>Taxis:</strong> Taxis are available in Taniti City for convenient point-to-point transportation.
                </p>
                <p class="content-text">
                    <strong>Rental Cars:</strong> Cars can be rented from a local rental agency near the airport if you prefer to explore the island at your own pace.
                </p>
                <p class="content-text">
                    <strong>Bicycles:</strong> Bikes and helmets are available to rent from several vendors around the island. Please note that helmets are required by law when cycling on Taniti.
                </p>
                <p class="content-text">
                    <strong>Walking:</strong> Taniti City is fairly flat and very walkable. The area surrounding Merriton Landing is also easy to explore on foot, making these areas perfect for leisurely strolls between attractions.

                    <strong>Electricity:</strong> Power outlets on Taniti are 120 volts (the same as in the United States). Travelers from countries with different electrical systems should bring appropriate adapters.
                </p>
                <p class="content-text">
                    <strong>Currency:</strong> Taniti uses the U.S. dollar as its currency. Many businesses will also accept euros and yen. Several banks facilitate currency exchange, and many businesses accept major credit cards.
                </p>
                <p class="content-text">
                    <strong>Language:</strong> Many younger Tanitians speak fluent English, especially in tourist areas. Very little English is spoken in rural areas, particularly by older residents. Learning a few basic phrases in the local language is appreciated when visiting rural communities.

                <p class="content-text">
                    <strong>Crime:</strong> Violent crime is very rare on Taniti, but as tourism increases, there are more reports of pickpocketing and other petty crimes. We recommend standard precautions like securing valuables and being aware of your surroundings.
                </p>
                <p class="content-text">
                    <strong>Alcohol Policies:</strong> Alcohol is not allowed to be served or sold between the hours of midnight and 9:00 a.m. The drinking age on Taniti is 18, and while the drinking age is not strictly enforced, we encourage responsible consumption.
                </p>
                <p class="content-text">
                    <strong>Road Safety:</strong> If you're cycling, remember that helmets are required by law. When driving, be cautious on rural roads which may be narrower than what you're accustomed to.
